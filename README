SimplifiedTranslation
================

Simplified Translation is a plugin for translating ActiveRecord models. This model
fits more for application with base language (which is mostly used) and some other
languages. All translations are sotred in separate table. Eg.

products -> product_trl

product_trl
  language_id
  record_id
  tranlsation_column1
  tranlsation_column1
  ...

For now SimplifiedTranslation works with Globalite plugin, but it could be easily extended
by adding new LocaleAdapter.

SimplifiedTranslation adds some new methods to existing model. Eg we have a product model
with column 'name' and have base site language 'english' and two others 'Russian' and 'Latvian'
So we have:

name
name=()
name_en
name_en=()
name_lv
name_lv=()
name_ru
name_ru=()

Example
=======

The way this plugin works. 

1. Specify columns you need to translate

class Product << ActiveRecord::Base
   translates :name, :desciption
end

2. Create migration for translations storing

$ script/generate model_translation Product
$ rake db:migrate

That is actually it.

$ script/console
>> product = Product.find(:first)
>> product.name_ru = "продукт"
 => "продукт"
>> product.name
 => "product"
>> Locale.set_code(:"ru-RU")
 => :RU
>> product.name
 => "продукт"
